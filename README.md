# Oakfield Eco Farm

This website is inspired by a local Eco Farm in my area that does not have their own website. I love what they do and I thought it

# Features

## colors 

 I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co) to help me pick the colours I was looking for and to get the values for them. I wanted to keep it earthy and based the colour system around the colour of a carrot.  I used a light green in the header and footer and any boxes. The headings and text is a very dark green. The the transparent boxes and hover activity is an orange colour. Behind the boxes I have used an off white colour, as I felt white was not warm enough for the site.

## Header

### Navigation
* Featured at the top of the page to  the left shows the farm name, which links to the home page.
* On the right hand side there are further links: Home, Our Farm & Shop, Order Online.
* The navigation is using a font that is soft amd rounded with a colour that contrasts well with the background.

### Logo
* Featured on the left hand corner of the page is a logo I created myself using [Canva](https://canva.com).
