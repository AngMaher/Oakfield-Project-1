## colors 

 I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co) to help me pick the colours I was looking for and to get the values for them. I wanted to keep it earthy and based the colour system around the colour of a carrot.  I used a light green in the header and footer and any boxes. The headings and text is a very dark green.
